# Basic-Contacts-App
This is a basic contacts web app created with node.js, express.js, and various npm packages (see package.json).
A user can log in to their account and manage their contacts.

I used mongodb for the server program. I used the npm package mongoose.js to communicate with the database server.

To run this on your machine:

1)Clone all the code from this repository:
https://github.com/sukhbirs112/Basic-Contacts-App.git

2)Download, configure, set up database folder for mongodb (see mongodb docs)

Note: Uses default port 27017 and the "test" database. Creates a colletion called "users".
3)Launch the database server

4)Run "npm start" in the root directory where you have cloned the code (directory containing app.js)

5)Visit http://127.0.0.1:3000/
